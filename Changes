revision 1.77  2014-01-17
----------------------------
    - Reintroduce { -not => undef } column operator (regression from 1.75)

revision 1.75  2013-12-27
----------------------------
    - *UPCOMING INCOMPATIBLE BUGFIX*: SQLA used to generate incorrect SQL
      on undef-containing lists fed to -in and -not_in. An exception will
      be raised for a while before properly fixing this, to avoid quiet
      but subtle changes to query results in production
    - Deprecate and warn when supplying an empty arrayref to like/not_like
      operators (likely to be removed before 2.0)

    - Warn when using an inequality operator with a multi-value array to
      arrive at what amounts to a 1=1 condition (no pre-2.0 plans to fix
      this behavior due to backwards comp concerns)
    - Fix false negative comparison of ORDER BY <function> ASC
    - More improvements of incorrect parsing (placeholder at end of list
      element)
    - Fix typos in POD and comments (RT#87776)

    - Change parser to not eagerly slurp RHS expressions it doesn't recognize

revision 1.73  2012-07-10
----------------------------
    - Fix parsing of ORDER BY foo + ?
    - Stop filling in placeholders in `format-sql` since it does not support
      passing values for them anyway
    - Fix parsing of NOT EXISTS
    - Fix over-eager parenthesis unrolling

----------------------------
    - Add quotes for populated placeholders and make the background
      magenta instead of cyan
    - Color and indent pagination keywords
    - Fix a silly bug which broke placeholder fill-in in DBIC
    - Installs format-sql to format SQL passed in over STDIN
    - Switch the tokenizer to precompiled regexes (massive speedup)
    - Rudimentary handling of quotes ( 'WHERE' vs WHERE )

----------------------------
revision 1.51  2009-03-28 10:00 (UTC)
    - fixed behavior of [-and => ... ] depending on the current
      condition scope. This introduces backwards comp with 1.24

    - fixed test subs (is_same_*) in SQL::Abstract::Test to return the correct test value
    - do not version MANIFEST

    Version 1.50 was a major internal refactoring of SQL::Abstract.
    Great care has been taken to preserve the published behavior
    documented in previous versions in the 1.* family; however,
    some features that were previously undocumented, or behaved.
    differently from the documentation, had to be changed in order
    to clarify the semantics. Hence, client code that was relying
    on some dark areas of SQL::Abstract v1.* might behave differently
    in v1.50.

----------------------------
revision 1.49_04  2009-03-03
    - add support for a [\%column_meta => value] bind value format

----------------------------

      of 'columns'

    - added an AST-aware SQL::Abstract::Test library for sql syntax tests
    - vastly expanded test coverage
    - support for the { operator => \'...'|\['...', @bind] } syntax
      allowing to embed arbitrary operators on the LHS
    - fixed multiple regressions wrt DBIx::Class

----------------------------

    - support for literal SQL through the [$sql, bind] syntax.

    - fixed bug with global logic of -and/-or (no side-effects any more)
    - changed logic for distributing an op over arrayrefs
    - fixed semantics of  _bindtype on array args
    - dropped the _anoncopy of the %where tree. No longer necessary.
    - dropped the _modlogic function
    - Make col => [] and col => {$op => [] } DTRT or die instead of generating
      broken SQL. Added tests for this.
    - Added { -desc => 'column' } order by support
    - Tiny "$_"-related fix for { -desc => 'columns'} order by support
      tests + docs
